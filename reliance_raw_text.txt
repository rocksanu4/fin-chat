To The Members of Reliance Industries Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Reliance Industries Limited (“the Parent”) 
which includes its joint operations and its subsidiaries 
(the Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to as 
“the Group”), and the Group’s share of profit / loss in 
its associates and joint ventures, which comprise the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31st March, 2024, and 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including 
Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flow and the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity for the year ended on that date, and 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, including 
a summary of material accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, and based on the 
consideration of reports of the other auditors on separate /
consolidated financial statements / financial information 
of the subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures referred 
to in the Other Matters section below, the aforesaid 
Consolidated Financial Statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in 
the manner so required and give a true and fair view in 
conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed 
under Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended 
(‘Ind AS’), and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of 
the Group as at 31st March, 2024, and their consolidated 
profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their 
consolidated cash flows and their consolidated changes in 
equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
(SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group, its associates and joint 
ventures in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) 
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to 
our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under 
the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code 
of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by 
us and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in 
terms of their reports referred to in the sub-paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of the Other Matters section below, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the 
matters described below to be the key audit matters to be 
communicated in our report.

of natural gas before the Hon’ble Bombay High Court.
	
Refer Notes 34.3 and 34.4 to the Consolidated Financial

Matter relating to trading in shares of Reliance 
Petroleum Limited (‘RPL’):
	
Securities Appellate Tribunal judgement dated 5th 
November, 2020, dismissing the Parent’s appeal made in 
relation to Order passed by the Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (‘SEBI’) under Section 11B of the SEBI Act, 
1992 in connection with trades by the Parent in the stock 
exchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum 
Limited, then subsidiary of the Parent, against which an 
appeal has been filed with the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
India which is pending.
	
Refer Note 35 (III) to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
	
Due to complexity involved in these litigation matters, 
management’s judgement regarding recognition, 
measurement and disclosure of provisions for these legal 
proceedings is inherently uncertain and might change over 
time as the outcomes of the legal cases are determined.
	
Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter.
	
−Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Parent’s legal 
counsel involved in the process.
	
−Reviewed the disclosures made by the Parent in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
	
−Obtained Management Representation Letter on the 
assessment of these matters.
2. Fair Valuation of Investments
As at 31st March 2024, the Parent has investments of C 78,093 
crore in Equity and Preference Shares of Jio Digital Fibre Private 
Limited (‘JDFPL’) which are measured at fair value as per Ind AS 
109 read with Ind AS 113.
These investments are Level 3 investments as per the fair value 
hierarchy in Ind AS 113 and accordingly determination of fair 
value is based on a high degree of judgement and input from 
data that is not directly observable in the market. Further, the 
fair value is significantly influenced by the expected pattern of 
future benefits of the tangible assets of JDFPL (fibre assets).
Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter.
Refer Notes 2 and 37A to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

following:

of the controls established by the Parent in the process of

3. Revenue Recognition
(a)	
The auditors of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (‘RJIL’), 
a step-down subsidiary of the Parent, have reported 
revenue recognition as a key audit matter due to the high 
volumes of data processed by the IT systems and the 
complexity of those IT systems.
In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors of 
RJIL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures performed by 
them to address the key audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary 
auditors, the audit procedures performed by them included and 
were not limited to the following:
	
−Evaluated and tested the design, implementation and 
operating effectiveness of the relevant business process 
controls, inter-alia controls over the capture, measurement 
and authorisation of revenue transactions, involving internal 
Information Technology (IT) specialists for the automated 
controls, interface controls and reports generated through 
various relevant IT systems involved in the revenue process.
	
−Involved internal IT specialists and tested the IT environment 
inter-alia for access controls, change management and 
application specific controls in the IT Systems over RJIL’s billing 
and other relevant support systems.
	
−Tested collections and the reconciliation between revenue 
per the billing system and the financial records. Performed 
procedures to test the computation of revenue and 
deferred revenue.
(b)	
The auditors of Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (‘RRVL’), 
a subsidiary of the Parent, have reported revenue 
recognition as a key audit matter at its subsidiary 
viz., Reliance Retail Limited (‘RRL’). RRL is engaged in 
organised retail and the trading transactions generating 
revenue comprising of high volume of individually small 
transactions which increases the risk of revenue being 
recognised inappropriately and which highlights the 
criticality of sound internal processes of summarising 
and recording sales. RRL trades in various consumption 
baskets on a principal basis and recognises full value of 
consideration as its revenue. The revenue is recognised 
on transfer of control of traded goods to the customers. 
Transfer of control coincides with collection of cash or 
cash equivalent from customers. In view of the above 
and since revenue is a key performance indicator for RRL, 
revenue recognition is identified as a key audit matter.
In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors of 
RRVL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedure performed by 
them to address the key audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary 
auditors, the audit procedures performed by them included and 
were not limited to the following:
	
−Obtained understanding of the process followed by the 
management to record the revenue from each store.
	
−Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of 
the internal controls established by RRL over reconciliation of 
revenue recorded with underlying collection made by RRL.
	
−Involved information technology specialist to test the 
automated controls and reports involved in the reconciliation 
of revenue.
	
−On a test-check basis, selected samples of stores on various 
dates. For such selections, obtained details of revenue 
recorded through various modes of payment from RRL’s 
accounting system. Reconciled revenue recorded as per such 
details with the underlying collection made by RRL as per 
cash receipts, merchant payment reports, and other third 
party supporting.
4. Information Technology (IT) systems and controls over 
financial reporting
We identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting 
as a key audit matter for the Parent because its financial 
accounting and reporting systems are fundamentally reliant 
on IT systems and IT controls to process significant transaction 
volumes, specifically with respect to revenue and raw material 
consumption. Also, due to such large transaction volumes and 
the increasing challenge to protect the integrity of the Parent’s 
systems and data, cyber security has become more significant. 
Automated accounting procedures and IT environment controls, 
which include IT governance, IT general controls over program 
development and changes, access to program and data and
Our procedures included and were not limited to the following:
	
−Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging 
IT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and 
internal audit at the Parent and identified IT applications that 
are relevant to our audit.
	
−Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of IT general controls over program development and changes, 
access to program and data and IT operations by engaging 
IT specialists.

IT operations, IT application controls and interfaces between 
IT applications, are required to be designed and to operate

any key threats addressed by the Parent in the current year.

financial reporting of the Parent by engaging IT specialists.
	
−Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of controls relating to data transmission through the different 
IT systems to the financial reporting systems by engaging 
IT specialists.
Information Other than the Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
	
−The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual Report, but does 
not include the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon.
	
−Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
	
−In connection with our audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read 
the other information, compare with the financial 
statements / financial information of the joint 
operations, subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates 
audited by the other auditors, to the extent it relates 
to these entities and, in doing so, place reliance on the 
work of the other auditors and consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the 
Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge 
obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. Other information 
so far as it relates to the joint operations, subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and associates, is traced from their 
financial statements / financial information audited by 
the other auditors.
	
−If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and 
Those Charged with Governance for the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to 
the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements 
that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance including 
other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows 
and consolidated changes in equity of the Group including 
its associates and joint ventures in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India including 
Ind AS specified under Section 133 of the Act. The 
respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are 
responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and its associates 
and its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting 
frauds and other irregularities; selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Directors of 
the Parent, as aforesaid.
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 
respective Management and Board of Directors of the 
companies included in the Group and of its associates 
and joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability 
of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
respective Board of Directors either intend to liquidate their 
respective entities or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are also 
responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of 
the Group and of its associates and joint ventures.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a 
207
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24


whole are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of these Consolidated Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
	
−Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
	
−Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether the Parent has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls.
	
−Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the management.
	
−Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the 
Group and its associates and joint ventures to continue 
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention 
in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group and its 
associates and joint ventures to cease to continue as a 
going concern.
	
−Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial 
Statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
	
−Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group and its associates and joint 
ventures to express an opinion on the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. We are responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the audit of 
the financial statements of such entities or business 
activities included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of which we are the independent auditors. 
For the other entities or business activities included 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have 
been audited by the other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We 
remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in 
aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider 
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors (i) in planning 
the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results 
of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified 
misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
of the Parent and such other entities included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

Independent Auditor’s Report


Report on the Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 
3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Reliance Industries Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Parent”) as at and for the year ended 
31st March, 2024, we have audited the internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Parent and its subsidiary companies, its 
associate companies and joint venture companies, which 
are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal 
Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Parent, its 
subsidiary companies, its associate companies and joint 
venture companies, which are companies incorporated 
in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements based on the internal control with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements criteria 
established by the respective Companies considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the respective company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Parent, its subsidiary companies, its 
associate companies and its joint venture companies, which 
are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the 
Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) 
of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding 
of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and 
the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the 
subsidiary companies, associate companies and joint 
venture companies, which are companies incorporated 
in India, in terms of their reports referred to in the Other 
Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Parent, its subsidiary companies, its 
associate companies and its joint venture companies, which 
are companies incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal financial control with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted 
213
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
“ANNEXURE A” 
To The Independent Auditor’s Report
(Referred to in paragraph 1(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date)


accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be 
detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the 
internal financial control with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with 
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us and based on the 
consideration of the reports of the other auditors referred 
to in the Other Matters paragraph below, the Parent, 
its subsidiary companies, associate companies and joint 
venture companies, which are companies incorporated in 
India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements and such internal financial controls with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements were 
operating effectively as at 31st March, 2024, based on 
the criteria for internal financial control with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements established by the 
respective companies considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act 
on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements insofar as it relates to 102 subsidiary 
companies, 32 associate companies and 12 joint venture 
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, is 
based solely on the corresponding reports of the auditors of 
such companies incorporated in India.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the 
above matters.

Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024


	
	
Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating to 
project, net of income earned during the project 
development stage prior to its intended use, 
are considered as pre-operative expenses and 
disclosed under Capital Work-in-Progress.
	
	
Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment 
is provided using written down value method 
on depreciable amount except in case of certain 
assets of Oil to Chemicals and Other Segment, 
which are depreciated using straight line method. 
Depreciation is provided based on useful life of 
the assets as prescribed in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of the 
following assets, where useful life is as under:
Particular
Depreciation
Fixed Bed Catalyst (useful 
life: 2 years or more)
Over its useful life as 
technically assessed
Fixed Bed Catalyst (useful 
life: up to 2 years)
100% depreciated in the 
year of addition
Premium on Leasehold Land 
(range up to 99 years)
Over the period of lease 
term
Plant and Machinery (useful 
life: 25 to 50 years)
Over its useful life as 
technically assessed
Buildings (useful life: 30 to 
65 years)
Over its useful life as 
technically assessed
	
	
The residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment are 
reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate. 
	
(d)	 Leases
	
	
The Group, as a lessee, recognises a right-of-
use asset and a lease liability for its leasing 
arrangements, if the contract conveys the 
right to control the use of an identified asset. 
Initially the right of use assets measured at cost 
which comprises initial cost of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or 
before the commencement date plus any initial 
direct costs incurred. Subsequently measured 
at cost less any accumulated depreciation/ 
amortisation, accumulated impairment losses, if 
any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the 
lease liability.
	
	
The right-of-use assets is depreciated/ amortised 
using the straight-line method from the 
commencement date over the shorter of lease 
term or useful life of right-of-use asset.
	
	
The Group measures the lease liability at the 
present value of the lease payments that are not 
paid at the commencement date of the lease. 
The lease payments are discounted using the 
interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can 
be readily determined. If that rate cannot be 
readily determined, the Group uses incremental 
borrowing rate.
	
	
For short-term and low value leases, the Group 
recognises the lease payments as an operating 
expense on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
	
(e)	 Intangible Assets
	
	
Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition 
net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and 
rebate less accumulated amortisation / depletion 
and impairment loss, if any. Such cost includes 
purchase price, borrowing costs, and any cost 
directly attributable to bringing the asset to 
its working condition for the intended use, net 
charges on foreign exchange contracts and 
adjustments arising from exchange rate variations 
attributable to the Intangible Assets.
	
	
Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating 
to project, net of income earned during 
the project development stage prior to its 
intended use, are considered as pre-operative 
expenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets 
Under Development.
	
	
The Group assesses if useful life of an intangible 
asset is finite or indefinite.
	
	
A summary of the amortisation / depletion policies 
applied to the Group’s Intangible Assets with a 
finite life to the extent of depreciable amount is

economic benefits, in accordance with 
the applicable Accounting Standards.
Others
In case of Jetty, the aggregate amount 
amortised to date is not less than the 
aggregate rebate availed by the Group. 
In case of Platforms and related Product 
Developments, over a period ranging 
from 5 to 25 years.
	
	
The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method for Intangible Assets with a finite useful 
life are reviewed at each reporting date.
	
(f)	 Inventories
	
	
Items of inventories are measured at lower of 
cost and net realisable value after providing 
for obsolescence, if any, except in case of by-
products which are valued at net realisable value. 
	
	
Cost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw 
materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing 
materials, trading and other products are 
determined on weighted average basis.
	
(g)	 Provisions
	
	
Provisions are recognised when the Group has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as 
a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. If the effect of the 
time value of money is material, provisions are 
discounted using a current pre-tax rate that 
reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific 
to the liability. When discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the passage of 
time is recognised as a finance cost. 
	
	
Provision for Decommissioning Liability
	
	
The Group records a provision for 
decommissioning costs towards site restoration 
activity. Decommissioning costs are provided 
at the present value of future expenditure using 
a current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred 
to fulfil decommissioning obligations and are 
recognised as part of the cost of the underlying 
assets. Any change in the present value of the 
expenditure, other than unwinding of discount 
on the provision, is reflected as adjustment to 
the provision and the corresponding asset. The 
change in the provision due to the unwinding 
of discount is recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
(h)	 Contingent Liabilities
	
	
Disclosure of contingent liability is made when 
there is a possible obligation arising from past 
events, the existence of which will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one 
or more uncertain future events not wholly within 
the control of the Group or a present obligation 
that arises from past events where it is either not 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle or a 
reliable estimate of amount cannot be made. 
	
(i)	 Current Tax and Deferred Tax 
	
	
The tax expenses for the period comprise 
of current tax and deferred tax. The Group 
exercises judgment in computation of current tax 
considering the relevant rulings and reassesses 
the carrying amount of deferred tax assets / 
liabilities at the end of each reporting period. 
	
(j)	 Share Based Payments
	
	
In case of Group equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions, where the Company grants 
stock options to the employees of its subsidiaries, 
the transactions are accounted by increasing 
the cost of investment in subsidiary with a 
corresponding credit in the equity. 
	
(k)	 Foreign Currencies Transactions and 
Translation
	
	
Exchange gains or losses on foreign currency 
borrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016 which 
are related to the acquisition or construction of 
qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost 
of such assets.
	
(l)	 Revenue Recognition
	
	
Revenue from contracts with customers is 
recognised when control of the goods or services 
are transferred to the customer at an amount that 
reflects the consideration entitled in exchange for 
those goods or services. The Group is generally 
the principal as it typically controls the goods or 
services before transferring them to the customer.
	
	
Revenue is measured at the amount of consideration 
which the Group expects to be entitled to in 
exchange for transferring distinct goods or 
services to a customer as specified in the contract, 
excluding amounts collected on behalf of third 
parties (for example taxes and duties collected 
on behalf of the government). Consideration is 
generally due upon satisfaction of performance 
obligations and a receivable is recognised when it 
becomes unconditional.

Generally, the credit period varies between 0-60 
days from the shipment or delivery of goods or 
completion of services as the case may be. The 
Group provides volume rebates to certain customers 
once the quantity of products purchased during 
the period exceeds a threshold specified and also 
accrues discounts to certain customers based on 
customary business practices which is derived 
on the basis of crude price volatility and various 
market demand – supply situations. Consideration 
are determined based on its most likely amount. 
Generally, sales of petroleum products contain 
provisional pricing features where revenue is initially 
recognised based on provisional price. Difference 
between final settlement price and provisional price 
is recognised subsequently.
	
(m)	Financial Instruments
	
	
i.	
Financial Assets
	
	
	
Purchase and sale of Financial Assets are 
recognised using trade date accounting. 
Trade receivables that do not contain 
a significant financing component are 
measured at transaction price.
	
	
	
The Company has elected to account for its 
investments in associates and joint venture at 
cost less impairment loss (if any). 
	
	
	
All other equity investments are measured 
at fair value, with value changes recognised 
in Statement of Profit and Loss, except 
for those equity investments for which 
the Group has elected to present the 
value changes in ‘Other Comprehensive 
Income’. However, dividend on such equity 
investments are recognised in Statement 
of Profit and Loss when the Company’s 
right to receive payment is established. The 
investments in preference shares with the 
right to surplus assets which are in nature 
of equity in accordance with Ind AS 32 are 
treated as separate category of investment 
and measured at Fair Value Through Other 
Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI). Other 
Financial Assets are generally measured at 
Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) 
except where the Group, based on the 
business model objectives, measures these 
at Amortized Cost or Fair Value Through 
Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI).
	
	
	
The Group uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) 
model, for evaluating impairment of Financial 
Assets other than those measured at Fair 
Value Through Profit Or Loss (FVTPL).
	
	
	
Expected Credit Losses are measured 
through a loss allowance at an amount 
equal to: 
	
−The 12-months expected credit losses 
(expected credit losses that result from 
those default events on the financial 
instrument that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date); or 
	
−Full lifetime expected credit losses 
(expected credit losses that result from 
all possible default events over the life of 
the financial instrument).
	
	
	
For Trade Receivables, the Group applies 
‘simplified approach’ which requires 
expected lifetime losses to be recognised 
from initial recognition of the receivables. 
	
	
	
The Group uses historical default rates to 
determine impairment loss on the portfolio 
of trade receivables. At every reporting date 
these historical default rates are reviewed 
and changes in the forward-looking estimates 
are analysed.
	
	
	
For other assets, the Group uses 12 month 
ECL to provide for impairment loss where 
there is no significant increase in credit risk. 
If there is significant increase in credit risk 
full lifetime ECL is used. 
	
	
ii.	
Financial Liabilities 
	
	
	
For trade and other payables maturing 
within one year from the balance sheet 
date, the carrying amounts are determined 
to approximate fair value due to the short 
maturity of these instruments.
	
	
iii.	
Derivative Financial Instruments and 
Hedge Accounting 
	
	
	
The Group uses various derivative financial 
instruments such as interest rate swaps, 
currency swaps, forwards & options and 
commodity contracts to mitigate the risk 
of changes in interest rates, exchange rates 
and commodity prices. At the inception of 
a hedge relationship, the Group formally 
designates and documents the hedge 
relationship to which the Group wishes 
to apply hedge accounting and the risk 
management objective and strategy for 
undertaking the hedge. 
	
	
	
Any gains or losses arising from changes in 
the fair value of derivatives are taken directly 
to Statement of Profit and Loss, except for 
the effective portion of cash flow hedge 
which is recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income and later to Statement of Profit and 
Loss when the hedged item affects profit 
or loss or is treated as basis adjustment if a 
hedged forecast transaction subsequently 
results in the recognition of a Non-Financial 
Assets or Non-Financial liabilities. 
227
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24


	
	
	
Hedges that meet the criteria  for hedge 
accounting are accounted for as follows: 
	
	
	
A.	
Cash Flow Hedge 
	
	
	
	
The Group designates derivative 
contracts or non-derivative Financial 
Assets / Liabilities as hedging 
instruments to mitigate the risk of 
movement in interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates for foreign exchange 
exposure on highly probable future cash 
flows attributable to a recognised asset 
or liability or forecast cash transactions. 
	
	
	
B.	
Fair Value Hedge 
	
	
	
	
The Group designates derivative 
contracts or non-derivative Financial 
Assets / Liabilities as hedging 
instruments to mitigate the risk of 
change in fair value of hedged item due 
to movement in interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates and commodity prices.
	
	
iv.	
Offsetting 
	
	
	
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are 
offset and the net amount is presented in 
the balance sheet when, and only when, the 
Group has a legally enforceable right to set 
off the amount and it intends, either to settle 
them on a net basis or to realise the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously. 
	
(n)	 Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity
	
	
Oil and Gas Joint Arrangement are in the nature of 
joint operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities 
as well as income and expenditure are accounted 
on the basis of available information on a line‑by-
line basis with similar items in the Financial 
Statements, according to the participating 
interest of the Group.
	
	
The Group follows the Guidance Note on 
Accounting for Oil and Gas producing activities 
– Ind AS issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India for the purpose of 
accounting.  Seismic costs, geological and 
geophysical studies, petroleum exploration 
license fees and general and administration costs 
directly attributable to exploration and evaluation 
activities are expensed off. The costs incurred on 
acquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on 
exploration and evaluation other than those which 
are expensed off are accounted for as Intangible 
Assets Under Development. All development 
costs incurred in respect of proved reserves are 
also capitalised under Intangible Assets Under 
Development. Once a well is ready to commence 
commercial production, the costs accumulated 
in Intangible Assets Under Development are 
classified as Intangible Assets corresponding 
to proved developed oil and gas reserves. The 
exploration and evaluation expenditure which 
does not result in discovery of proved oil and gas 
reserves and all cost pertaining to production are 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
	
	
The Group uses technical estimation of reserves 
as per the Petroleum Resources Management 
System guidelines 2011 and standard geological 
and reservoir engineering methods. The reserve 
review and evaluation is carried out annually. 
C.	 Critical Accounting Judgements and 
Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
	
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements 
require management to make judgement, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amount 
of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the 
accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these 
assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes 
that require a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
	
(A)	 Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves
	
	
The determination of the Group’s estimated 
oil and natural gas reserves require significant 
judgements and estimates to be applied and these 
are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such 
as the availability of geological and engineering 
data, reservoir performance data, acquisition 
and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and 
commodity prices all impact on the determination 
of the Group’s estimates of its oil and natural gas 
reserves. The Group bases it’s proved reserves 
estimates on the requirement of reasonable 
certainty with rigorous technical and commercial 
assessments based on conventional industry 
practice and regulatory requirements.
	
	
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are 
used to calculate depletion charges for the 
Group’s oil and gas properties. The impact of 
changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt 
with prospectively by amortising the remaining 
carrying value of the asset over the expected 
future production. Oil and natural gas reserves 
also have a direct impact on the assessment of the 
recoverability of asset carrying values reported in 
the financial statements.
	
	
Details on proved reserves and production both 
on product and geographical basis are provided in 
Note 34.
	
(B)	 Property Plant and Equipment / Other 
Intangible Assets
	
	
Estimates are involved in determining the cost 
attributable to bringing the assets to the location

and condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating in the manner intended by the 
management. Property, Plant and Equipment / 
Other Intangible Assets are depreciated /  
amortised over their estimated useful life, 
after taking into account estimated residual 
value. Spectrum Cost is amortised over its 
balance validity period, based on the expected 
pattern of consumption of the expected future 
economic benefits.
	
	
Management reviews the estimated useful life 
and residual values of the assets annually in 
order to determine the amount of depreciation / 
amortisation to be recorded during any reporting 
period. The useful life and residual values are 
based on the Group’s historical experience with 
similar assets and take into account anticipated 
technological and future risks. The depreciation / 
amortisation for future periods is revised if there 
are significant changes from previous estimates.
	
(C)	 Provisions
	
	
The timing of recognition and quantification of 
the liability (including litigations) requires the 
application of judgement to existing facts and 
circumstances, which can be subject to change. 
The carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities 
are reviewed regularly and revised to take account 
of changing facts and circumstances.
	
(D)	 Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible 
Assets under Development and Intangible 
Assets with Indefinite Useful Life
	
	
Management reviews the carrying value of 
goodwill, intangible assets under development 
and intangible assets with indefinite useful 
life annually, to determine whether there has 
been any impairment by allocating the value of 
goodwill, intangible assets under development 
and intangible assets with indefinite useful life 
to a Cash Generating Unit (CGU). The Group has 
identified CGUs’ for this purpose, considering 
the nature of the businesses to which each of the 
CGU relates.
	
	
Value in use i.e. the enterprise value of each CGU 
is aggregate of cash flow projections, for five 
years as approved by Senior Management and 
beyond five years extrapolated using a long-term 
growth rate which ranges from 2% to 5%. Cash 
flow projections are discounted by a pre-tax 
discount rate, being the Weighted Average Cost of 
Capital (WACC), which ranges from 8% to 12%.
	
	
The Management believes that any reasonably 
possible change in the above key assumptions on 
which recoverable amount is based would not 
cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed 
the aggregate recoverable amount of the CGU.
	
	
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite 
lives have been allocated to the respective CGUs. 
During the year ended March 31, 2024, the 
Group has determined that there is no impairment 
towards these assets.
	
(E)	 Impairment of Financial and 
Non‑Financial Assets
	
	
The impairment provisions for Financial Assets 
are based on assumptions about risk of default 
and expected cash loss rates. The Group uses 
judgement in making these assumptions and 
selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, 
based on Group’s past history, existing market 
conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at 
the end of each reporting period.
	
	
In case of non-financial assets, the Group 
estimates asset’s recoverable amount, which 
is higher of an asset’s or Cash Generating Units 
(CGU’s) fair value less costs of disposal and its 
value in use.
	
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. In determining 
fair value less costs of disposal, recent market 
transactions are taken into account, if no such 
transactions can be identified, an appropriate 
valuation model is used.		
	
(F)	 Fair Value Measurement
	
	
For estimates relating to fair value of financial 
instruments refer Note 37 of Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
	
(G)	 Leases
	
	
The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies 
to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 
116. Identification of a lease requires significant 
judgement. The Group uses judgement in 
assessing whether a contract (or part of contract) 
include a lease, the lease term (including 
anticipated renewals), the applicable discount 
rate, variable lease payments whether are 
in-substance fixed. The judgement involves 
assessment of whether the asset included in the 
contract is a fully or partly identified asset based 
on the facts and circumstances, whether the 
contract include a lease and non-lease component 
and if so, separation thereof for the purpose of 
recognition and measurement, determination of 
lease term basis, inter alia the non-cancellable 
period of lease and whether the lessee intends 
to opt for continuing with the use of the asset 
upon the expiry thereof, and whether the lease 
payments are fixed are variable or a combination 
of both.

The estimates of Rate of Escalation in salary considered in actuarial valuation, take into account inflation, seniority, promotion 
and other relevant factors including supply and demand in the employment market. The above information is certified by 
the actuaries.
	
	
The Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets is determined considering several applicable factors, mainly the composition of 
Plan Assets held, assessed risks, historical results of return on Plan Assets and the Group’s policy for Plan Assets Management.
	
VIII)	 The expected contributions for Defined Benefit Plan for the next financial year will be in line with financial year 
2023‑24.
	
IX)	
These plan’s typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Longevity Risk and 
Salary Risk.
Investment Risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is 
determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.
Interest Risk
A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset by 
an increase in the return on the plan's debt investments.
Longevity Risk

mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of 
the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.
Salary Risk
The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan 
participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.

The reserve estimates for producing fields are revised based on the performance of producing fields and with respect to 
discovered fields, the revision are based on the revised geological and reservoir simulation studies.
	
34.3	The Government of India (GOI), disallowed certain costs which the Production Sharing Contract (PSC), relating to Block KG-
DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) entitles the Company to recover. The Company maintains that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its 
costs under the terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost. 
The Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI of $ 165 million 
(for C 1,373 crore) being the Company’s share (total demand $ 247 million – C 2,060 crore) towards additional Profit Petroleum 
has been considered as contingent liability in the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024.
	
	
In supersession of the Ministry’s Gazette notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10th January, 2014, the GOI 
notified the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 on 26th October, 2014. The GOI had directed the Company to 
instruct customers to deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the 
guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1st November, 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited 
to the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool Account is C 295 
crore (net) as at 31st March, 2024. Revenue has been recognized at the GOI notified prices on GCV basis, in respect of gas 
quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1st November, 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been challenged under 
cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication. 
	
34.4	(a)	
GOI sent a notice to the KG-D6 Contractor on 4th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately 
US $1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC’s blocks. RIL, as Operator, for and on behalf of all 
constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI contesting its unfair claim. The Arbitral 
271
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24


Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24th July, 2018 upheld Contractor’s claims. GOI filed an Appeal on 15th November, 
2018 before the Single Judge Bench of Hon’ble Delhi High Court (DHC), against the Final Award. Vide Judgment dated 
9th May, 2023 the Hon’ble Single Judge of DHC upheld the Arbitration Award and dismissed GOI’s appeal challenging 
the Award. An appeal was filed by GOI before the Division Bench of DHC to set aside single judge’s judgment which is 
presently sub-judice.
	
	
(b)	
Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants) 
against GOI under the PSCs for Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks due to difference in interpretation of certain 
PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitration Tribunal has issued a number of final partial awards in this 
matter, some of which have (in part) not been in Claimant’s favour. The arbitration is ongoing and a final award is yet to be 
issued. The arbitration has also led to satellite litigation in India (presently ongoing) and in the UK, which has resulted in 
court judgments that have not always been entirely in RIL’s favour
	
	
(c)	
NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for a 
period of 17 years. This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company’s fact witnesses in 
the suit are to be cross examined by NTPC.
	
	
Considering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible 
exposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company’s legal position in the ongoing arbitration/ litigations. 
Moreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.

(III)	 On December 16, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a show cause notice (“SCN”) inter alia to the 
Company (RIL) in connection with the trades by RIL in the stock exchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum Limited, 
then a subsidiary of RIL. By an order dated March 24, 2017, the Whole Time Member (“WTM”) passed directions: (i) prohibiting 
inter alia RIL from dealing in equity derivatives in the ‘Futures & Options’ segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for 
a period of one year from the date of the order; and (ii)  to disgorge from RIL an amount of C 447 crore along with interest at the 
rate of 12% per annum from November 29, 2007, till the date of payment. On an appeal by RIL, Securities Appellate Tribunal 
(“SAT”) by a majority order (2:1), dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020, and directed RIL to pay the disgorged amount 
within sixty days from the date of the order. The appeal of RIL and others had been admitted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
of India. By its order dated December 17, 2020, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India directed RIL to deposit C 250 crore in the 
Investors’ Protection Fund, subject to the final result of the appeal and stayed the recovery of the balance, inclusive of interest, 
pending the appeal. RIL has complied with the order dated December 17, 2020, of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.
	
	
In the above matter, the adjudicating officer of SEBI (“AO”) while adjudicating the show cause notice dated November 21, 
2017 issued, inter alia, to RIL passed an order on January 1, 2021 imposing a penalty of C 25 crore on RIL which has been paid 
under protest. In the appeal filed by RIL, the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal vide order dated December 4, 2023, did 
not interfere with the order passed by the AO since the matter was already covered by its earlier decision dated November 5, 
2020, which is in appeal by RIL before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. RIL has filed an appeal in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
India against Order dated December 4, 2023 of SAT.

The financial instruments are categorised into three levels based on the inputs used to arrive at fair value measurements 
as described below:
	
	
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
	
	
Level 2: Inputs other than the quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
or indirectly; and
	
	
Level 3: Inputs based on unobservable market data.
	
	
Valuation Methodology
	
	
All financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value as described below:
	
	
a)	
The fair value of investment in quoted Equity Shares, Bonds, Government Securities, Treasury Bills, Certificate of 
Deposits and Mutual Funds is measured at quoted price or NAV.
	
	
b)	
The fair value of Interest Rate Swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on 
observable yield curves.
	
	
c)	
The fair value of Forward Foreign Exchange contracts and Currency Swaps is determined using observable forward 
exchange rates and yield curves at the balance sheet date.
	
	
d)	
The fair value of over-the-counter Foreign Currency Option contracts is determined using the Black Scholes 
valuation model.
	
	
e)	
Commodity derivative contracts are valued using available information in markets and quotations from exchange, brokers 
and price index developers.
	
	
f)	
The fair value for Level 3 instruments is valued using inputs based on information about market participants assumptions 
and other data that are available.
	
	
g)	
The fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis.
	
	
h)	
All foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rate at reporting date.

B.	
Financial Risk Management
	
	
The Group’s activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Within 
the boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework, the Group uses derivative instruments to manage the 
volatility of financial markets and minimise the adverse impact on its financial performance.
	
	
i)	
Market Risk
	
	
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as 
equity price risk and commodity risk.
	
	
	
a)	
Foreign Currency Risk
	
	
	
	
Foreign Currency Risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign currency rates. Exposures can arise on account of the various assets and liabilities which are 
denominated in currencies other than Indian Rupee.
	
	
	
	
The following table shows foreign currency exposures in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen on financial instruments 
at the end of the reporting period. The exposure to all other foreign currencies are not material.

ii)	
Commodity Price Risk
	
	
	
Commodity price risk arises due to fluctuation in prices of crude oil, other feed stock and products and bullion. The Group 
has a risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices 
and freight costs.
	
	
	
The Group’s commodity price risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control 
processes. In accordance with the risk management policy, the Group enters into various transactions using derivatives 
and uses over-the-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and 
freight exposure.
	
	
iii)	
Credit Risk
	
	
	
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due 
causing financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises from Group’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and 
receivables from customers and other financial instruments. The Group ensures that sales of products are made to 
customers with appropriate creditworthiness. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance 
function, with a framework in place to quickly identify, respond and recognise cases of credit deterioration.
	
	
	
The Group has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business 
activities. Credit risk across the Group, is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Group 
Guarantees, advance payments, security deposits and factoring and forfaiting without recourse to Group. The Group 
restricts its fixed income investments in liquid securities carrying high credit rating.
	
	
iv)	
Liquidity Risk
	
	
	
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Group maintains 
sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Group accesses global and local 
financial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient 
funding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash 
flow position and ensures that the Group is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.
	
	
	
The Group’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury 
pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or 
invest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, 
money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid 
concentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.

Hedge Accounting
	
	
The Group’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other 
feedstock, refined products, precious metals, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group has 
adopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge 
accounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded 
futures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this 
objective. 
	
	
There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Group has established a hedge 
ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method 
and Dollar offset method.
	
	
The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:
	
	
- Differences in the timing of the cash flows. 
	
	
- Different indexes (and accordingly different curves). 
	
	
- The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements.
	
	
The table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:
